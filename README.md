Hello! I was taking a Database System Management Laboratory course while working on this project, and I've learned about how I can design a relational database with an ER diagram. I put what I'd learned to use by creating an e-commerce website project written in PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. Basically, I've practiced designing databases with an ER diagram, doing a CURD operation, designing and building a frontend, and using a useful javascript library such as SweertAlert 2 to send notifications to the UI, but the UI is not responsive. While doing this project, I've never had any knowledge about PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or SQL before, so I've spent a lot of time studying all of this, and the result website and database turned out well, I think. After finishing this project, I realized that I prefer frontend programming to backend programming, so I'll keep learning everything I can about frontend programming.Â
